## Introduction

A website where user can search restaurants in Helsinki area. User can also do the following:

- Add favorites
- Filter restaurants by categories
- Login with email, Google or Github account
- View each restaurants information on a separate page

Main idea of the project was to focus on usability and simplycity. I wanted to have main functionalities visible and usable on the front page. The page is also fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices. 

Data for the database was extracted from REST API for City of Helsinki Service Map and imported to MongoDB. The data was modified to fit this project. The data includes over 700 restaurants.
