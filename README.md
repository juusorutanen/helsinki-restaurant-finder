## Introduction

A website where user can search restaurants in Helsinki area. User can also do the following:

- Add favorites
- Filter restaurants by categories
- Login with email, Google or Github account
- View each restaurants information on a separate page

Main idea of the project was to focus on usability and simplycity. I wanted to have main functionalities visible and usable on the front page. The page is also fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices.
